		<b id="title">Preview Review: the Coen Brothers' A Serious Man</b>
		<div class="smaller"><i>by Julian Sancton</i></div>
		<p>What's most striking about the preview for the Coen brothers' new film, A Serious Man, aside from the rhythmic head-smashing that meters out a heightened sense of tension and absurdity, is the absence of known faces. Immediately that immerses the viewer in the story. There is nothing of this world distracting the viewer from the world of the movie. And it shows the Coens are confident enough in their story to let it stand on its own, rather than propped on the legs of celebrity. The second most striking thing is that we learn practically nothing about the plot.</p>
		<p>As Hollywood Elsewhere's Jeff Wells points out, the trailer is a work of art in itself. It deviates from the hackneyed three-act preview structure that tends to give away too much. Here, using repeated footage, bizarre juxtapositions, and that constant, painful sound of a cranium being bludgeoned, master trailer editor Mark Woollen manages to convey the Coens' eye for the bizarre without revealing anything more than the fact that there is a character, he is Jewish, and he has serious problems.</p>
		<p>But I'm not getting my hopes up. After letting the superb preview for last year's Burn After Reading trick me to into seeing into what was ultimately a disappointing movie, I'm reserving judgment until I see the film.</p>
