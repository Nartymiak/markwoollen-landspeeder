		<p>For example, bawdier red-band trailers—those with nudity, profanity, or violence—are now common on the Web, as are longer trailers freed from their traditional two-and-a-half-minute length. Warner Bros. (TWX) successfully launched The Dark Knight with a mega-trailer—the first six minutes of the actual movie played in front of I Am Legend four years ago. The studio is looking to repeat that success by running the opening of The Dark Knight Rises before Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol. Editor Stephen Garrett (co-founder of Kinetic Trailers) thinks the Internet helps push creativity. "The good trailers reverberate in a way they haven't before," he says. "Clients remember those campaigns, and they'll either go back to that vendor or challenge another vendor to do something just as interesting and dramatic themselves."</p>
		<p>The proliferation of trailer houses has also improved the products they create. As cheaper editing software such as Apple's (AAPL) Final Cut has brought down the cost of professional systems, more top trailer cutters are starting their own businesses. Michael Andolina, Shawn Yashar, and Justin King-Hall recently left a well-known trailer production outfit and have prospered with their new company, Transit, which finished a trailer for Puss in Boots. King-Hall says they're far from alone: "A lot of editors go out and start their own company, maybe because they want to create a company that is a reflection of their own style or attitude." The result is an increasingly diverse field of unique voices. As Woollen notes, "It's a seriously competitive business. You have several companies working on a given campaign, all trying to do their best work and get finished."</p>
		<p>In this environment, the key to success and survival for both the trailer houses and the films they represent is to constantly defy convention. Last year's innovation quickly becomes this year's cliché. Woollen now fields requests to replicate his Social Network trailer: "If you're working on a drama, everyone is excited to use a Radiohead song, and I don't really want to hear those anymore! I feel like those have been done—let's keep trying to find what the new thing is."</p>
