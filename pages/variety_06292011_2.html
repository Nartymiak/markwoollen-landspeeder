			<p>"The thing that's unique about Mark," says Angus Wall, who won an Oscar earlier this year as co-editor of "The Social Network" and who has cut trailers himself, "is that there are formulas for making trailers. And all those formulas have these tricks. And after a certain point, a lot of trailer cutters become a collection of their tricks. But not Mark. I think he considers each film individually and his approach depends on the film. And that's the reason he's so good."</p>
			<p>It was Wall who suggested Woollen to Errol Morris, who didn't need much encouragement. "He's legendary," Morris says of Woollen. "I've gotten a really favorable response to the trailer. People write me via various blogs and websites, responding to it. I got a message from someone recently who had gone to the movies and said the best thing they saw was the trailer for 'Tabloid.' "</p>
			<p>However, Morris added, "the proof is in the pudding. Will it drive people to the theater?"</p>
			<p>And there's no real way to quantify that. Web hits don't translate into dollars; trailers are sometimes better than the movies; screening trailers for enthusiastic fanboys at Comic-Con can prove a bust (see "Scott Pilgrim," and "Tron: Legacy"). "The best gauge," says Wall, "is 'Do you like it?' and 'Does it sell the movie in a somewhat genuine way? Does it get inside the skin of the movie?' "</p>
			<p>That is Woollen's guiding principle. And it means playing to your strengths.</p>
			<p>"We don't do the summer blockbuster-type movies, but we might do something like 'Super 8,' " he says. "We might do Academy films like 'Social Network' and 'Black Swan' and have historically done a lot of director-driven films like 'Tree of Life' and independent films. We don't do horror really well."</p>
			<p>Unless it's existential horror: One of Woollen's most acclaimed trailers was for "A Serious Man," the Coen brothers' Jewish-identity-angst comedy. "I had worked on a number of Coen brothers films, like 'The Big Lebowski,' so I had a long history with them and it was great to have that kind of a challenge and do something different. It wasn't an ordinary movie. And shouldn't have had an ordinary trailer."</p>
			<p>Likewise, "Tree of Life," which paired Woollen with one of his favorite filmmakers.</p>
