 <p>You may not know Mark Woollen's name, but thanks to his work on some of the most attention-grabbing trailers of the past twenty years, you're probably familiar with his work. Whether it's the subtle heartbreak of &quot;<a class="" href="http://www.indiewire.com/film/12-years-a-slave" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.indiewire.com/film/12-years-a-slave">12 Years a Slave</a>,&quot; the technical wizardry of &quot;<a class="" href="http://www.indiewire.com/film/birdman" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.indiewire.com/film/birdman">Birdman</a>,&quot; or one of his most recent efforts, the immersive two-minute hurricane that is the trailer for &quot;The Revenant,&quot; Woollen has been turning the teaser into an art form all its own. This week on Indiewire Influencers, Woollen sits down with Indiewire Editor in Chief Dana Harris for a conversation about his career in the field and what it's like to work with such a varied list of collaborators.</p><p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/227374127&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false"></iframe></p><p>Woollen's career has now spanned multiple decades, long enough to see a shift from a time when trailers played almost exclusively in theaters to now, when they're readily available at a moment's notice. But the changing venues for the premiere of a trailer haven't affected Woollen's work as much as you might think. &quot;If anything,&quot; Woollen explains, &quot;the Internet really has opened up things for immediate feedback the second a trailer drops. There's all kinds of comments and you get your report card on how you did.&quot;</p><p><a class="" href="http://www.indiewire.com/article/2016-oscar-predictions-20150312" target="_blank" title="Link: http://www.indiewire.com/article/2016-oscar-predictions-20150312">READ MORE: 2016 Oscar Predictions</a></p><p>Working with some of the top directors in the field brings with it a unique atmosphere where Mark and his team aren't strictly hired hands, but also have to consider a filmmaker's literal and figurative vision. &quot;I always feel a great responsibility with what we're doing,&quot; Mark says of crafting the audience's initial window into a particular film, adding, &quot;That trailer we make is really the world's first introduction to their child. So you want to make it right.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>What&nbsp;clich&eacute;s does he avoid? And how exactly did Gnarls Barkley's &quot;Crazy&quot; become the unofficial &quot;Birdman&quot; anthem?
