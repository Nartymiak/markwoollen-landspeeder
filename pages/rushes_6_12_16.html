<p><strong>The film trailer maker reveals what it takes to make an award-winning clip, and who his best customers are. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Millions of people across the world have seen his work. They’ve shared it, talked about it, laughed at it and raged, but you wouldn’t recognise him if his face were plastered across a London bus. Mark Woollen is a movie trailer maker. He is the founder of <em>Mark Woollen and Associates</em>, and the go-to man for turning those shiny new Hollywood films into 90-second appetizers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sat in his editing suite in Santa Monica, Woollen is getting over the flu. He talks quietly and calmly, a little unexpected from a man in charge of a creative group of twenty. Teams of three tackle a trailer together, with Woollen keeping an eager eye over them. Woollen was the man who made us question Ben Affleck in <em>Gone Girl</em> and long to see Michael Fassbender as <em>Macbeth</em>. His team was responsible for “the scariest trailer ever made”: the 2014 foreign horror <em>Goodnight Mommy,</em> and his iPod housed the soundtrack for the future award-winning trailer <em>The Social Network</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may seem like a straightforward job turning a feature film into a quick-fire titbit, but when you’re faced with hours of footage and no prior knowledge of it, it can be a challenge to start from a clean slate. “We get to experience movies without being exposed to any sort of advertising at all, which is a rare treat.” It’s a situation a select few ever experience. When new films are released, we only ever see them with advertising forced upon us beforehand. You have to have a confidence about you in this business to know you are capable of taking a $135 million film in your bare hands, and making sure you’re able to whet the appetites of the world to want to go and see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although trailer making is a team effort, the result rests on the shoulders of Woollen. He decides how a film is interpreted, and therefore how the rest of the world will see it. Of course the trailers have to be approved by the director and the studio before release, but the stress of spending sometimes up to 9 months working on someone else’s expensive baby, is a stressful task. Occasionally, directors want to be very much involved in the process, whilst others greet the team as they walk out the door. As the company doesn’t advertise, they rely on referrals and recommendations between directors, and it’s these recommendations that have given the company top clientele. Richard Linklater, Terrence Malick, Steve McQueen, and the Coen brothers to name a great few- and the odd returning, loyal customers. “There are half a dozen or so [filmmakers] that return to us, Alejandro Iñárritu worked with us for <em>21 Grams</em>, last year he returned with <em>Birdman</em> and this year with <em>The Revenant</em> for one example.” Now that’s quite the punter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a fascinating yet challenging balance between Woollen’s role, he is in the middle of a perfect storm. He has to please everyone: the filmmaker, the studio and the ratings board. Whilst balancing all that, he has to try not to get caught and bogged down in the whirlwind of negativity that is inevitable. “Any trailer that we’ve ever put out, you can read the comments section on the internet” Woollen laughs. “As much as anyone loves something there’s an equal number that feel the other way, so we’re never pleasing everybody.” It seems Woollen has formed a thick skin after 16 years of being exposed to this, but if he knows he and his team have done their best, then he’s happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s clear Woollen is as enthusiastic and passionate about his work today as he was when he started out. Surprisingly, there is a collection of contemporary art filling the attic walls of the workplace, instead of memories of past projects. “We don’t have a single film poster in our offices, too depressing to see those things staring at you after you’ve finished with them. [With] our offices, we are thinking what’s the next film, what’s the new idea, and that’s where we are going to find inspiration from, not looking backwards for it.”</p>
