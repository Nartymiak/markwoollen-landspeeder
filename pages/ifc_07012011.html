		<b id="title">"Social Network" tops The Golden Trailer Awards</b>
		<div class="smaller"><i>by Matt Singer</i></div>
		<p>An obvious but deserving choice, the amazing trailer for David Fincher's "The Social Network" walked away the big winner at this week's 12th Annual Golden Trailer Awards in Los Angeles. The "Social Network" spot, by Mark Woollen &amp; Associates, won four awards: Best Drama Trailer, Best Music, Most Original, and the top prize, Best in Show.</p>
		<p>Like I said, not a shocking victor, but a worthy one; we picked it as the best trailer of 2010 on our end of the year podcasts back in December. Other wins included "Tree of Life," also by Mark Woollen &amp; Associates, won Best Independent.</p>
