		<p>Studios spend a premium to create that anticipation. Although Hollywood is loath to relinquish marketing costs, it's generally acknowledged that Prints & Advertising budgets can regularly swell to over half a film's production cost. (A single trailer can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $100,000, though the most lucrative contracts encompass multiple versions of the trailer.) Of all the ways to hype a movie these days—billboards, talk show interviews, junkets, viral campaigns—trailers continue to be the cornerstone of film marketing. Marc Weinstock, president of worldwide marketing for Sony Pictures (SNE), says exit surveys consistently show trailers are the most influential driver of audience interest—generating 50 percent, compared with 30 percent for TV spots. With movie attendance at its lowest level since 1997, the pressure increasingly is on trailers to cut through the cultural white noise. "Our biggest fear is being average," says Weinstock. "We don't want people to think, ‘Maybe I'll see that movie the second weekend.' We want that trailer where people go, ‘I have to see that movie now!' "</p>
		<p>In this environment, the key to success and survival for both the trailer houses and the films they represent is to constantly defy convention. Last year's innovation quickly becomes this year's cliché. Woollen now fields requests to replicate his Social Network trailer: "If you're working on a drama, everyone is excited to use a Radiohead song, and I don't really want to hear those anymore! I feel like those have been done—let's keep trying to find what the new thing is."</p>		</div>
